                    <hr class="small">
                    <p class="card-text">
                        As someone who grew up in the rural Midwest, I never considered computer science or software developement as a possible jobâ€”let alone a job I was capable of doing.
                         I didn't find the career path until my second year of college, when I took my
                           first coding class.  Immediately, I went from not being interested in coding, to sitting in office
                            hours every chance I could, asking my somewhat exasperated professor how to do this and that (even
                             then, she was the person who inspired me to keep going). 
                             <br><br>
                        Three years later, I got the chance to dive into STEM. I changed my major and learned as many skills as I could.  
                        Whether it was a chance to hold calculus teaching sessions and tutor new college students, to moderating servers and writing
                         code to manage them, to the ins and outs of cloud security at a Fortune 500 company, I have been blessed to try an array
                          of opportunities.  Now that I am a few short months from graduating with my bachelors in computer science, I am excited to see what lies ahead!

                    <hr class="small">
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Although I have more experience in cybersecurity and machine learning, the career I aspire to is DevOps Engineering.  
                        My plan to reach this goal has two parts, a short term I am working on currently, and a long term that I want to finish within a year.  
                        <br><br>
                        My short term list is as follows, as in the next 6 months I have developed and hope to continue developing knowledge in: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bash and scripting</li>
                            <li>Docker</li>
                            <li>Git</li>
                            <li>AWS</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                    
                        <p class="card-text">In the next 1-2 years I hope to develope more skils I have not learned yet, such as:</p>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Kubernetes</li>
                            <li>Jenkins and CI/CD pipelines</li>
                            <li>Azure</li>
                            <li>GCP</li>
                        </ul>
