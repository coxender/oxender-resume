                    <hr class="small">
                    <p class="card-text">
                        As someone who grew up in the rural Midwest, I never considered computer science or software developement as a possible job, let alone a job I was capable of doing.
                         I didn't fins the career path until my second year of college, when I took my
                           first coding class.  Immediately, I went from not being interested in coding, to sitting in office
                            hours every chance I could, asking my somewhat exasperated professor how to do this and that (even
                             then, she was the person who inspired me to get where I am). 
                             <br><br>
                        Three years later, I got the chance to dive into STEM, I changed my major, and learned as many skills as I could.  
                        Whether it was a chance to hold calculus teaching session and tutor new college students, to moderating servers and writing
                         code to manage them, to the in's and out's of cloud cybersecurity at a Fortune 500 company, I have been blessed to try an array
                          of opportunities.  Now that I am a few short months from graduating with my bachelors, I am so excited to see what lies ahead!

                    <hr class="small">
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Although I have more experience in cybersecurity and machine learning, the career that I aspire to is a DevOps Engineering.  
                        In my long term plan, I have been developing my front-end skills and my bash skills, while planning to learn a fuller knowledge of the software and skills needed for this job in the coming months.
